Wording for registration and welcome have been updated to make them gender neutral and use “Mother Reminder” rather than “Healthy Mothers Group.” See excel spreadsheet.

Auto response to any incoming message – need to respond, even if at first we do not do anything with the incoming messages. Added a potential auto-response to message excel spreadsheet. Potential to have a pool of generic responses containing different medical messages.

Refinements to registration timing – Added immediately welcome message, ask next question as soon as one is answered. Reduce time to 1-hr for re-asking and moving to next question. Updated messages in XLS dated March 22.

Added clarification question if district cannot be matched by system.

Need to check how the message schedule begins – if there is a significant delay between the final registration step and the first health message we should build in a message or two that can be sent in the meantime.

Get message schedule working!

GUI improvements – I suggest Revence & Moses/Sam sit down and go through the GUI of U-Report to see what’s possible and maybe borrow some code.

Better search/filter function for mothers and messages. Filter by district, search for number etc. Search incoming messages with free-form text.
