Good location matching.
Kind time.

Wording for registration and welcome have been updated to make them gender neutral and use “Mother Reminder” rather than “Healthy Mothers Group.” See excel spreadsheet.

Added clarification question if district cannot be matched by system.

Need to check how the message schedule begins – if there is a significant delay between the final registration step and the first health message we should build in a message or two that can be sent in the meantime.

Get message schedule working!

GUI improvements – I suggest Revence & Moses/Sam sit down and go through the GUI of U-Report to see what’s possible and maybe borrow some code.

Better search/filter function for mothers and messages. Filter by district, search for number etc. Search incoming messages with free-form text.
